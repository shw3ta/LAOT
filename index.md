<!-- 

<span class='newthought'>Hello there.</span>
Here, I attempt to understand a few concepts and methods in Machine Learning, from the ground up.  -->


## Contents 
<!-- ### Basics{% include sidenote.html id='about-notes' note='These notes are based on my reading of [this book](www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/). I discovered this book while TAing for CS1390 *Introduction to Machine Learning*, course taught by [Subhashish Banerjee](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~suban/) at [Ashoka University](https://www.ashoka.edu.in/) in Monsoon 2021. I write here in the interest of making the content more accessible to a lay-reader.' %} -->

1. [Empirical Risk Minimization](contents/ERM/intro): What is observable? To what extent is the observable representative of the whole? How does it affect learning?

2. [A Formal Model](contents/ERM/PAC-learning): The importance of picking representative training sets. PAC learning. Relaxing a few assumptions. 

3. [The Generative Model](contents/EM/generative-models/): An introduction to important ideas in inference.

4. [Spherical Cows](contents/EM/spherical-cows): Gaussian Mixture Models, Expectation Maximization, Disentangling Gaussians (review of methods).
