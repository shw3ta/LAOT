The scientific enterprise is broad and deep. It is most often propelled by expansion at the surface, but, if the surface gets stretched too thin, it might as well just break off and become something else altogether. We often need to revisit old ideas to ensure that the whole does indeed benefit from its parts. Old ideas are at the core, and we need to spend some time trying to understand them, so that our new ideas are not flimsy and easy to poke holes in. Hopefully, some day, I understand better than I do today. 

Here on this website, you will see my attempts at [understanding machine learning: from theory to algorithms](www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/). I like the book and I like this approach. I plan to decipher some notation that seems unintuitive at first, but then necessary and useful later, and hopefully, they will help us understand the vey cool ideas they convey.{% include marginnote.html id='credits' note='I took this template from notes made for Stanford\'s [CS228](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/). After a long search for templates that did not look garrish with latex, I can finally admit that I am satisfied.'%}


I cannot give proofs of correctness of my own explanations, which are bound to change when something finally clicks; so I will definitely update these posts with any epiphany I have. However, I am fairly certain that I am not too far off from the truth *wink wink*.
